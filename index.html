      <p><strong>Suspension Design Engineer</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Designed Baja car uprights in SolidWorks, achieving a 46% reduction in turning radius over past designs,
          improving maneuverability and steering response.
        </li>
        <li>
          Performed FEA to validate uprights with a factor of safety greater than 3, reducing weight by 44% while
          improving dynamic load performance.
        </li>
        <li>
          Created detailed manufacturing drawings in SolidWorks to ensure part accuracy, ease of fabrication,
          and alignment with design requirements.
        </li>
        <li>
          Programmed and machined Baja uprights on a 3-axis CNC using Fusion 360, optimizing manufacturing efficiency
          and dimensional accuracy.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Vehicle Dynamics Lead</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Calculated Ackermann steering angles for inner and outer wheels, achieving a turning radius under 10 ft,
          guiding front suspension design decisions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Calculated lateral, vertical, and longitudinal forces during cornering to support suspension optimization
          and ensure components withstand real-world loads.
        </li>
        <li>
          Calculated the vehicle center of gravity (CG) to support steering and braking system design.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
